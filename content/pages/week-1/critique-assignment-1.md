Overview of Critique Assignments
--------------------------------

In 6.033 you'll complete a series of three critiques, designed to build analytical and communication skills. The first critique requires you to understand and assess a distributed system based on an analytical framework presented in the {{% resource_link 40c59cdf-5cc3-002f-4f57-52bcd63188fe "critique worksheet (PDF)" %}}.

In the second critique (of a different system), you'll use your answers to a similar worksheet to write a 2â€“3 page critique of the system. The third critique will take the form of a peer review of another team's Design Project Report. You'll receive instruction about each of these critiques as the semester progresses.

This Critique
-------------

For this first critique, you should evaluate and assess Domain Name System (DNS) using the {{% resource_link 40c59cdf-5cc3-002f-4f57-52bcd63188fe "critique worksheet (PDF)" %}}. This worksheet walks you through the process of analyzing the system described lecture and in the textbook.

We are intentionally releasing this assignment before you have learned about DNS; that's because we wanted you to have the worksheet available as you did the reading (if you've done the reading without the worksheet, no problem! The worksheet should go quickly).
