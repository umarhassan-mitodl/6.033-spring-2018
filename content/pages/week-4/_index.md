(Not available to OCW users.)

Tutorial 4: Writing the Critiques & Introduction to Collaboration
-----------------------------------------------------------------

As you know, in 6.033 you'll complete a series of three critiques, designed to build analytical and communication skills. The first critique required you to understand and assess a distributed system based on an analytical framework presented in the critique worksheet. In this critique, you'll use your answers to a similar worksheet to write a 2–3 page critique of the system. The third critique will take the form of a peer review of another team's Design Project Report. You'll receive instruction about each of these critiques as the semester progresses.
