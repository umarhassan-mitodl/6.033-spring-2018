Tutorial 6: Assembling the Design Project Preliminary Report
------------------------------------------------------------

The {{% resource_link 85b670dd-8de4-dbf6-b591-b48baa5d9789 "Design Project Preliminary Report (PDF)" %}} was assigned in {{% resource_link 81056cb9-5545-9139-0582-b2e55570d21a "Week 3." %}} The preliminary report for the design project will be evaluated by your Recitation Instructor and your Communication Instructor. Your Communication Instructor will evaluate it according to the grading rubric and assign a letter grade. Your Recitation Instructor will evaluate the preliminary report to make sure your design is on the right track; you should incorporate their feedback into the presentation and report. See the {{% resource_link 73594177-84bd-559f-acb2-aadc9d04abe7 "Design Project" %}} section for more details.
